# About Me

Hello! My name is Muhammad Ali Khan and I am currently pursuing an MSc in International Business Administration with a focus on Data Science and Decision Support at Europa Universit√§t Viadrina, Frankfurt (Oder). I hold a BBA in Finance from SZABIST Karachi. I am passionate about leveraging data and analytical techniques to drive business decisions and support organizational growth.

My professional experience includes an internship at Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) in the Corporate Planning and Business Development Department, where I gained insights into the operations of a multimillion-dollar corporation and the Oil and Gas industry. I also enhanced my MS Office skills by creating presentations and editing dashboards for the department.

I have also worked as an Internet Sales Representative at Breakthru.pk, where I honed my customer service skills, and as an Amazon Virtual Assistant at the Brandock agency, where I developed my e-commerce and management skills.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am proficient in several languages including English (C1), German (A1), and Urdu (C2). My hobbies include swimming, football, and reading.
